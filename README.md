This repository contains a suite of codes that were used to model the Time Dependent problem for paste softening, as part of my thesis titled "[Modelling and analysis of paste flow in
high performance SÃ¸derberg electrodes](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:fe65fdfa-3765-4df0-a47b-47d499da0086)". 

In particular, these MATLAB codes are used for Chapter 2: A coupled flow and temperature model for paste softening, and Chapter 3: Time dependent solutions for coupled flow and temperature model for paste
softening.
